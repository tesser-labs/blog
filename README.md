## Writing a Post

To write a post, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Template**: Start by making a copy of the provided template file inside the posts folder.
2. **Write in Markdown**: Add your content in markdown format.
3. **Math Equations**: For math equations, use LaTeX syntax.
4. **Metadata**: The frontend website uses the frontmatter header to parse the post's metadata (e.g., author, date, title, etc.).

## Publishing a Post

To publish your post, set the `published` field in the frontmatter header to `true`.

Example:

```markdown
---
author: Your Name
date: YYYY-MM-DD
title: Your Post Title
published: true
---
```
